# 👋 Hi, I’m @trueberryless

My name is Felix Schneider, I'm a software engineer currently studying at secondary college of engineering.

# 👀 I’m interested in ...

- ... programming Blazor Applications,
- ... deploying Docker Iamges, and
- ... running them on my own server.

# 🌱 I’m currently trying to learn ...

- ... RegEx (Regular Expressions), but I don't want to because they are difficult and I can use GPT instead ...
- ... GitHub Actions which is a Trial and Error process
- ... many more things here and there

# 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

- ... some interesting Blazor Applications,
- ... Frontend Websites,
- ... Backend Databases, especially MongoDB and MySQL, and
- ... exciting projects overall
