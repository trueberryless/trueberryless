# 👋 Hi, I’m @trueberryless

My name is Felix Schneider, I'm a software engineer currently studying at secondary college of engineering. In my free time, I enjoy playing ball sports. Here I think of activities like dodgeball, basketball and ice hockey. Butwhen the opportunity arises to be active in a less large group, I am enthusiastic about golf, tennis or evenswimming. On the internet, I mostly go by the username trueberryless. My interests are paradoxes,mathematics, computer science and hexagons. Of course, I also like to play board and video games from time totime, my absolute favourite being Chess, followed by Settlers of Catan and Celeste. The latter is a 2D platformgame for the computer.
